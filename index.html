<h1>Background Information</h1>
<p>Clash Royale is a mobile game that was created on March 2nd, 2016. </p>
<h2>Coolest looking arena</h2>
<h3>Favorite Cards</h3>
<p>My personal favorite cards are dart goblin and dark prince. The reason for this is because dark prince has a shield and is very versatile as it can hit swarms, has good health, is a average amount of exlier, and is in general just
a reall cooly card. Dart goblin is my second favorite because it also is a very cool looking card and it is very useful in the field again air troops and shoots extremely fast.</p>
